                <h1>Getting The Right People</h1>

                    <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
                    <p>Getting the right people is all about finding a group that has an appropriate level of technical skills and behavior that suits the environment.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row sectionOdd">
                <div class="col my-auto">
                    <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
                    <p>During the 90s, companies placed a priority of process over people. This boggled people down under useless overhead procedure, and forced them to all act like robots rather than people. Handling groups of people like this in an environment driven by change is bound to fail as the business won't be able to keep up with needed adaptation and change.</p>

                <div class="col my-auto">
                    <h2>How this affects team performance</h2>
                    <p>Finding people that specialize in certain areas of the project, but can still manage to competently do or understand many different parts of the project allows for flexible collaboration between team members to accomplish a goal together. Placing more minds at a problem to come to a solution, rather than having a team of 10 people all working on 10 different solutions is a more beneficial strategy for success!</p>

                    <h2>Effects on Members</h2>
                    <p>Finding people that are good collaborators can take a lot of the stress out of a project, as they know that they have other people to support them, while also boosting their own productivity.</p>

                    <h2>What to look for</h2>
                    <p>Find people who are good at communicating, honest, and are willing to commit to any role assigned to them or that they pursue themselves. This will keep the members informed, honest, and productive in the team.</p>
