                <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
                <p>Getting the right people is all about finding a group that has an appropriate level of technical skills and behavior that suits the environment.</p>

                <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
                <p>During the 90s, companies placed a priority of process over people. This boggles people down under useless overhead procedure, and makes them all act like robots.</p>

                <h2>How this affects team performance</h2>
                <p>Finding people that specialize in certain areas of the project, but can competently do many different parts of the project allows for flexible collaboration between team members to accomplish a goal together.</p>

                <h2>Effects on Members</h2>
                <p>Finding people that are good collaborators can take a lot of the stress out of a project, as they know that they have other people to support them, while also boosting their own productivity.</p>

                <h2>What to look for</h2>
                <p>Find people who are good at communicating, honest, and are willing to commit to any role assigned to them or that they pursue themselves. This will keep the members informed, honest, and productive in the team.</p>
